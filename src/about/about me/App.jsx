            I am a Frontend Developer passionate about creating clean,
            responsive, and user-friendly websites. I specialize in building
            portfolio websites, browsing platforms, and modern responsive
            layouts that work seamlessly across devices. Currently, I focus on
            developing website designs provided by designers, turning static
            visuals into fully functional and interactive web experiences. With
            a strong emphasis on detail, performance, and usability, I aim to
            deliver websites that are both visually appealing and highly
            effective.
