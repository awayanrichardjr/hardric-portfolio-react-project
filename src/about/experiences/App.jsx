            From January 27 to May 9, 2025, I worked as an{" "}
            <b>
              HR Specialist/Assistant (On-the-Job Trainee) at New Ventures
              Multi-purpose Cooperative
            </b>
            , where I assisted with recruitment by screening resumes, scheduling
            interviews, and preparing onboarding documents. I helped maintain
            employee records, organized personnel files, supported orientations,
            and contributed to HR communications. I also gained exposure to
            employee relations by assisting with events, meetings, and reports,
            as well as learning basic timekeeping and payroll tasks. This
            experience strengthened my organizational, communication, and
            teamwork skills while giving me practical insights into the role of
            HR in supporting both employees and the organization.

            From 2020 to 2023, I worked as a{" "}
            <b>Freelance Digital Artist in the Davao Area</b>, providing
            creative digital art services to a variety of clients. My work
            involved creating customized illustrations, character designs, and
            digital portraits tailored to client needs and preferences. I
            collaborated closely with clients to understand their vision,
            delivered high-quality artworks within deadlines, and made revisions
            based on feedback to ensure customer satisfaction. This experience
            allowed me to improve my artistic skills, strengthen client
            communication, and manage projects independently, giving me valuable
            insights into both the creative and business sides of freelance
            work.
